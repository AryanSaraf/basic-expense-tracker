# BXT
The Basic eXpense Tracker (BXT) is a project I undertook as the second task in my internship with MotionCut. It is an application that runs in the terminal and allows you to manage your expenses. Negative expenses can be added as earnings.
## How-to
- Compile and run the BXT class file to start the program.
- All the available commands are made visible by typing the help command.
- You can add entries by providing the description, amount, and category of the expense.
- You can also view the entries filtered by category and date.
- Lastly, all the data can be deleted using the reset command.
